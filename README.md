This repository contains files that create a weather dashboard that will display current and five day weather forecasts of cities when prompted. On initial page load, the user types in the name of a city in the search box and clicks on the "Search" button. Upon button click, fetch calls are made to the One Call and the Geo API's of openweathermap.org. The fetched data is then dynamically written to the web page via javascript in the form of current day and five day forecasts. Executed searches are also saved just below the search button in the form of new buttons. The user may recall a previous search by clicking one of the buttons under the search button. All elements are styled with Boot Strap and the jquery DOM is utilized in the script executions.
